# Obtaining Matlab 

You can download Matlab from [Rowan University's Software Downloads](https://irt.rowan.edu/service-catalog/software/downloads/)
website. You'll need to create an account with Mathworks. The installation 
process is relatively easy; however, you need to make sure that you install 
Simulink and the Control Systems Toolbox.
